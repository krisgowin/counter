1.	Accounts and State: In Solana, everything that might need to store state, like a user's balance or a program's data, is stored in accounts. Each account can hold data and SOL (Solana's cryptocurrency), and is owned by a particular program.
2.	Passing State: When a transaction calls a program on Solana, the necessary accounts (which include the state information) are passed to the program as part of the transaction. This means that the state needed by the program to operate comes with the call.
3.	Statelessness of Contracts: The programs themselves are stateless, meaning they do not store any state internally. Instead, they operate on the state provided in these accounts. After processing, they can modify the state stored in these accounts.
4.	Concurrency and Performance: This approach allows Solana to execute transactions concurrently and at high speeds because the state is explicitly provided with each transaction, reducing the overhead of state management and allowing for more parallel processing.
5.	Committing State: Once a program processes a transaction and potentially alters the state in the provided accounts, the updated state is written back to the blockchain. This ensures that all changes are recorded and persistent.
